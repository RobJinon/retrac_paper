We would like to express our gratitude to our adviser, Assistant Professor Francis D. Dimzon, and co-adviser, Assistant Professor Christi Florence C. Cala-or, for the invaluable guidance and insights throughout the duration of this study. Your patience, motivation, and insightful comments greatly helped us in writing this study.

We would also like to give our thanks to the Universityâ€™s Cash Office and CAS Office of the College of Secretary for accomodating our inquiries regarding the process of requesting documents. To Mr. Enrique Legazpi III and Ms. Maureen Kay C. Ongo, your inputs helped in making this project possible.

Lastly, but certainly not the least, our deepest gratitude to our family and friends. Your support, understanding, and motivation, especially in these trying times, made it possible for us to continue working on this project.
