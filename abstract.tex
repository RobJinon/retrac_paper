Requesting documents from various offices in the University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) is both inefficient and decentralized in nature. Some requests are not processed and some are lost tracked. Although there is an existing document request and document tracking system in the UP system, it is only used at the administration level and is not accessible for students. ReTrac is a centralized document request and tracking system designed to make the requesting and tracking or request more efficient.
