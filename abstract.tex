Requesting documents from various offices in the University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) is both inefficient and decentralized in nature. Some requests are not processed and some are lost tracked. Although there is an existing document request and document tracking system in the UP system, it is only used at the administration level and is not accessible to students. 

Through this project, a website is created to address these issues. ReTrac is a centralized document request and tracking system designed to make the requesting and tracking of requests more efficient. Additionally, one of the key features of ReTrac is payment integration. The users would be able to pay for their requested documents within the platform itself.
