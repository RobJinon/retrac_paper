\section{Summary}
ReTrac is a document request and tracking system primarily designed for the use of the College of Arts and Sciences College Secretary, Cash Office, Students, and Alumni of the University of the Philippines. Traditional Document Request appears to be time-consuming and requires various emails to be sent between the college secretary and the cash office. The current face-to-face and online process require days of checking emails and some requests were overlooked due to the flooding of emails received daily by both offices. This makes the request trail hard to trace back nor provide up-to-date information regarding its status. Many students and alumni faced issues such as delay, and unavailability of bank accounts. Meanwhile, the office of the College Secretary was overwhelmed by requests during a certain season, this will help them manage how many requests they can receive daily and set forms that would be available for a specified season. The said system also integrates payment QR for faster payment processing. 

Some recommendations for improving ReTrac would be to add online wallet payment integration (i.e. Paymaya, GCash, etc.). Paymaya wasn\textsc{\char13}t able to respond, so online wallet payment integration wasn\textsc{\char13}t added. Another would be to preregister accounts via UP mail. Last,  is to add an admin portal to add or remove staff accounts.
