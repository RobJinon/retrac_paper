Adjusting to the new normal while working on this project has been quite a struggle. As such, we dedicate this project to our family and friends, who have been our source of inspiration and strength. This is for checking on us and motivating us to continue working on this project.

We would also like to dedicate this project to the university staff and our fellow students. Our shared experience regarding the process of requesting documents gave us the reason to work on this project. May this project help as you request documents within the university.
